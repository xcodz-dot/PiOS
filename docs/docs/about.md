# About PiOS
PiOS is initially a start from scratch project which uses
[Denver API](https://gtihub.com/xcodz-dot/denver) to manage all the internal
working. Its Predecessor HandyOS was published but only on PyPI. And it had
a predecessor as well PyOS, which was also abandoned.

It is basically a simple little hobby side project that is not really intended
for more than anything else. Have fun exploring. I am also in middle of
developing a app store and other things.
