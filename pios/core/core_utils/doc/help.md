# Man - Manual

**man** is a short copy of linux command `man`. **man** provides little bit of help on builtin commands.
To get a list of builtin commands:
```bash
help-core-utils  # This will print all the available internal commands
```

now you can simply prepend `man` before the command itself. So for example you are unable to understand what is `cat`,
you can simply type `man cat`, this will now print help for the command.
