# Cat - Concatinate

It accepts multiple arguments as input and prints them after reading them. this is particularly useful when
you want to have a quick look on a stored file.

This is the command structure

```bash
cat  # Does nothing
cat [filename]  # Reads and prints a single file
cat [filename] [...]  # Reads and prints multiple files
man cat  # prints this help message
```
