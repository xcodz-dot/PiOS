# PiOS
PiOS is a Python written Operating System which features almost everything in a minimal OS.
You can check also check-out [PiOS-SDK](https://github.com/xcodz-dot/PiOS-SDK) and
[Denver (Optional)](https://github.com/xcodz-dot/denver), if you want to develop applications for it.

For documentation you will have to wait, currently this project is in alpha stage (basic things are yet to implement)
